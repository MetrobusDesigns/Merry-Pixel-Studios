    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <hr>
    <p>I'm Chris, an aspiring full-stack web developer and the designer of this site.
    </p>
    I worked for 23 years as a professional senior analyst and leader in various government positions both in the
    military and as a civilian. When I worked with teams, I would frequently develop a small website, SharePoint, or
    wiki for them to collaborate with.
    After retiring from military service, I figured what better time to pursue something I loved doing; creating and
    designing websites. </p>
